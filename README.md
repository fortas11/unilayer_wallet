paying much attention to it.

After the installation is complete you'll see the main window of the wallet.
It is empty now and doesn't have any connected networks.
Setting up the url.conf file

Close the application for now.
Overwrite the existing ulr.conf file in the directory you chose (the default location is:
/home/[user]/.UniLayer) with the configuration file from the letter.
Now in the right upper corner of the wallet you can see the highlighted connection icon.
If you hover over it with the mouse pointer you’ll see the connected masternodes:
Congratulations, you’ve done the initialization step of the wallet!
Receiving tULR via Faucet
UniLayer Testnet is identical to UniLayer MainNet in terms of parameters. They are almost the
same! But in the UniLayer TestNet you can always receive ULR tokens for free. To make it
easier to separate each other the token in the TestNet has a bit different name: tULR (test ULR).
Visit the faucet on http://faucet.unilayer.io/
Paste your address from the Receive panel here and enter the desired amount of tULR tokens.
After synchronization you’ll see the tokens in your wallet!
What’s next?
What can be done next? You can set up a masternode or even become a validator!
You can upload your smartcontracts using cli and much more!
